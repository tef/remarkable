"I also dream about a modern replacement for LaTeX designed from the ground up
 to target multiple output formats (at least PDF, HTML, EPUB)"

	-- John MacFarlane, author of Pandoc

A markup language to produce PDF, HTML, EPUB documents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- TeX like syntax, but vastly simpler parsing rules.
- HTML, RST, LaTeX like semantics, i.e section, h1, strong, footnote
- More datastructures than just nodes and strings: lists, numbers, etc.

Check the README file for an exploration of other formats and design choices.

There's no accounting for taste:

- No Ascii Art for formatting semantics. All commands follow same form
- It should be trivial to include any text without escaping
- Invisible whitespace should have no effect, for ex: trailing whitespace 
- However, some commands may take an indented block.

Non Goals:

- Markdown esque shorthand. Will not be defined in the core language, but can be 
  added by filters.

- Programmable. The Language will be declarative, without macros.
  Can be added by filters.

Use cases:

- Technical writing, long and short form. API documentation. 
- Documents with embedded data, as well as links and forms. 
- Configuration files/directives, as well as describing Schemas

A structured markup language with inline object notation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 0: Everything is broken into words and paragraphs
	Multiple spaces are treated as one space, e.g.
 		Foo    Bar  	is:	Foo Bar
	Two line breaks mark the end of a paragraph, e.g
        	Hello           is:     Hello
                                
                Thing                   Thing

        One line break will be treated as a space between
	lines, including trailing/leading whitespace e.g:
	 	This		is: 	This Thing
		Thing
                			Over Here
		Over                      
               		Here                  

Rule 1: \ is the substituiton character.

	A \ indicates an escape, text substitution, or a command.

	\\ is a literal \, and  \, \{ \} \[ \] \! \: \; \= produce literals.

	Commands begin with a \ have a name, have a number of
	arguments,and end when there is no more arguments, 
	or a semicolon.

	e.g \bar			No args
	    hi \b{there} 		A text arg
	    hello \foo[name:1, a:2]	A collection arg
            \baz[1]{hello}{world!}	A mixture
	    foo\bar[1,2]baz		No ;
            Hello \foo;there		Ended with ;

	Commands can take collections, then text arguments. Usually 
	text inside [ .. ] is the text about how to format it, and
	text inside { .. } is the text to be formatted. These
	are covered in later rules.

	Command names may contain numbers, letters, underscores (_) and
	periods (.) but must not whitespace, control characters, or
	puncutation marks, especially ones used by the markup : \ { } [ ] ! : ; 

	Command names may include unicode numbers, letters.

        A semicolon (;) marks the end of a command, and is not treated 
        like text, so \foo[1]bar and \foo[1];bar are equivilent.

        There are commands for document structure as well as
        special characters too.

	A command with no name just lifts the arguments into the
	document, i.e \[1,2] is a list, \{ } is a text subelement,
	\{! is a raw element!} 

	A \ at the end of a line ignores the trailing whitespace
	until the first word of the next line.

	A \ at the end of the file is not an error, but will 
	have no effect.
	
Rule 2: Text

	Text is implicit, but subnodes can be created by
	\{ .... }, or used as arguments to commands
	e.g \foo{bar}{baz}
	    \section{\h1{blah}}

	You can use {{{, }}} too to break text over muliple lines.
	    \lol{{{
            a thing
            that is lol
            }}}

	Note: When you use  {{{ ... }}} you do not need to
	escape solitary }'s or }}'s inside.

	Rationale: It's a lot easier to trace missing bracket errors
	when you have to explicitly make it multiline.
	
Rule 3: Raw Text 
	In raw text nodes, backslashes have no meaning, and
	are marked by matching {! and !}'s with matching numbers of !
	e.g 	\foo{!{foo}!}	is	{foo}
		\foo{!bar\!!}	is	bar\!
		\foo{!!Hi!Ho!!} is	Hi!Ho

	{!... !} cannot have newlines but {{{! .... !}}} can

	Commands can take multiple raw text arguments
	Raw Text arguments cannot contain commands, or nest.
	Whitespace in raw text arguments is preserved.
	!'s are matched greedily, ie {!!!} is {!!! folowed by }

Rule 4: Implicit text: indented blocks and single lines.
	A command ending in : can be passed an indented text block
	as an argument.  e.g:	
		\cmd:			\cmd{{{hello
			hello		}}}
		blah
	
	Or, it can take up to the end of the line:
		\cmd: hello

	Any text indented more than the line of the original command
	is considered to be part of the block.

	The indented block continues until a line starts with less
	or equal indentation to the line with the command, and then
	the minimum whitespace prefix is removed from the block.

	The indent may be tabs or spaces, however they are not
	comparable. The minimum prefix is the set of whitespace
	shared by all non blank indented lines in the block. 

	If there is no consistent prefix for the block it will be 
	treated as an error.

	Blank or whitespace only lines will be treated
	as part of the block.

	If a command has ! at the end, the next consistently
	indented block of text is used as a raw text argument
	e.g:
		\cmd!                    or \cmd! textblock
			text block
	
Rule 5: Collections

	A collection is a list of items, seperated by commas, 
	with optional keys :i.e
	   \foo[1,2,3]         	    \foo[a:2,b:2, c:3] 

	There can be whitespace around the , or :
	and it will be ignored.
	
	Collections can be multiline, but items cannot be multiline
	Newlines imply commas, trailing commas are valid
	i.e \[a:     is an error, but \[a:2, is not
	      1,]                       b:3,] 
	

	Items can be
	 special	\[true, false, nil, NaN, -Inf, +Inf]
	 text		\["hi there",'hello','a4', ",",'a','''foo'''] 
	 numbers, 	\[1,2,3.0,4.5] # hex floats, too!
	 measurements	\[100%, 20mm]
	 collections	\foo[[1,2,3,'foo', 'bar']]
	 timestamps	hh:mm:ssTyyyy-mm-ddZ
	Keys can be strings with =, or any item with :
	 [a=1, b=2] or ["a": 1, "b": 2], or [123: "a", 456: "b"]
	  a=nnn keys follow command rules for parsing.

	items can be decorated
	@url "....", @color "....", @set [ ... ]
	
	\struct{name}['a','b','c','d','e'] \size{a4} \enum{paper}["A4", "a5"]
	some \ work inside ""'s 


Rule 6: Unicode, and document model. 
:
	Command names are NFC normalized.
	BOMs are ignored at beginning.
	Input should be utf-8, without surrogate pair characters.
	Unicode whitespace/para characters should be respected.

	The document described is turned into an object, text blocks with
	attributes, which can have an ordered list of children, which can
	be iterated through, or accessed by key. This is similar to the data
	structure used in collection arguments

Changelog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Proposal 7

No commands in keys, strings/items only, decorated items.

- Proposal 6

- Some cleanup and reordering. Collection arguments have grown into
an object notation, which felt inevitable. Either the markup language 
supported nested collections or people would ad-hoc them into strings

- Proposal 5

- Nailing down line continuations, reordering rules. Fixing
  indentation semantics, whitespace handling.
- Cleaning up most of the spec. ; *are* optional, bare commands are good too
- Explained justification of {}/{{{}}}

- Proposal 4

- Made unicode choices
- Use !, !!, etc for raw text blocks. Allows escaping without subsitutions
- Added back indented blocks for non raw text.
- Allowed _ and . in names.
- Line contiuations

Proposal 2/3:
- Fleshing out semantics of names and arguments.

Proposal 1:
- Functions take any variety of text and list args, but only
  raw blocks can be indented.
- Linebreaks are ignored.

Proposal 0:

- Added {{{}}} , raw blocks through function name suffix \foo!
- Functions take multiple args and text block, optionally indented.
- Args can be named, linebreaks are literal
